variables, such as a nurse, physician's assistant, clinical psychologist, clinical
pharmacist, or house staff physician. It is not necessary to include in this list a person
with only an occasional role, e.g., an on-call physician who dealt with a possible
adverse effect or a temporary substitute for any of the above.
c) The author(s) of the report, including the responsible biostatistician(s).
Where signatures of the principal signatory investigators are required by regulatory
authorities, these should be included in appendix 16.1.5 (see Annex II for a sample

officer should be provided in appendix 16.1.5.
7. INTRODUCTION
The introduction should contain a brief statement (maximum: 1 page) placing the study
in the context of the development of the test drug/ investigational product, relating the
critical features of the study (e.g., rationale and aims, target population, treatment,
duration, primary endpoints) to that development. Any guidelines that were followed in
the development of the protocol or any other agreements/meetings between the
sponsor/company and regulatory authorities that are relevant to the particular study,
should be identified or described.
8. STUDY OBJECTIVES
A statement describing the overall purpose(s) of the study should be provided.
9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan-Description
The overall study plan and design (configuration) of the study (e.g., parallel, cross-over)
should be described briefly but clearly, using charts and diagrams as needed. If other
studies used a very similar protocol, it may be useful to note this and describe any
important differences. The actual protocol and any changes should be included as
appendix 16.1.1 and a sample case report form (unique pages only; i.e., it is not
necessary to include identical pages from forms for different evaluations or visits) as
appendix 16.1.2. If any of the information in this section comes from sources other than
the protocol, these should be identified.
The information provided should include:
• treatments studied (specific drugs, doses and procedures)
• patient population studied and the number of patients to be included.
• level and method of blinding/masking (e.g., open, double-blind, single-blind, blinded
evaluators and unblinded patients and/ or investigators)
• kind of control(s) (e.g., placebo, no treatment, active drug, dose-response, historical)
and study configuration (parallel, cross-over)
• method of assignment to treatment (randomisation, stratification)
© EMEA 2006 10
==================== Page 4 ====================
• sequence and duration of all study periods, including pre-randomisation and post-
treatment periods, therapy withdrawal periods and single- and double-blind treatment
periods. When patients are randomised should be specified. It is usually helpful to
display the design graphically with a flow chart which includes timing of
assessments (see Annexes IIIa and IIIb for an example).
• any safety, data monitoring or special steering or evaluation committees
• any interim analyses.
9.2 Discussion of Study Design, including the Choice of Control Groups
The specific control chosen and the study design used should be discussed, as
necessary. Examples of design issues meriting discussion follow.
Generally, the control (comparison) groups that are recognised are placebo concurrent
control, no treatment concurrent control, active treatment concurrent control, dose
comparison concurrent control, and historical control. In addition to the type of control,
other critical design features that may need discussion are use of a cross-over design
and selection of patients with particular prior history, such as response or non-response
to a specific drug or member of a drug class. If randomisation was not used, it is
important to explain how other techniques, if any, guarded against systematic selection
bias.
Known or potential problems associated with the study design or control group chosen,
should be discussed in light of the specific disease and therapies being studied. For a
crossover design, for example, there should be consideration, among other things, of the
likelihood of spontaneous change in the disease and of carry-over effects of treatment
during the study.
If efficacy was to be demonstrated by showing equivalence, i.e., the absence of a
specified degree of inferiority of the new treatment compared to an established
treatment, problems associated with such study designs should be addressed.
Specifically there should be provided a basis for considering the study capable of
distinguishing active from inactive therapy. Support may be provided by an analysis of
previous studies similar to the present study with respect to important design
characteristics (patient selection, study endpoints, duration, dose of active control,
concomitant therapy, etc.) showing a consistent ability to demonstrate superiority of the
active control to placebo. How to assess the ability of the present study to distinguish
effective from ineffective therapy should also be discussed. For example, it may be
possible to identify a treatment response (based on past studies) that would clearly
distinguish between the treated population and an untreated group. Such a response
could be the change of a measure from baseline or some other specified outcome like
healing rate or survival rate. Attainment of such a response would support the
expectation that the study could have distinguished the active drug from an inactive
drug. There should also be a discussion of the degree of inferiority of the therapy (often
referred to as the delta value) the study was intended to show was not exceeded.
The limitations of historical controls are well known (difficulty of assuring
comparability of treated groups, inability to blind investigators to treatment, change in
therapy/disease, difference due to placebo effect, etc.) and deserve particular attention.
Other specific features of the design may also deserve discussion, including presence or
absence of washout periods and the duration of the treatment period, especially for a
chronic illness. The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection should be explained,
© EMEA 2006 11
==================== Page 5 ====================
if it is not obvious. For example, once daily dosing with a short half-life drug whose
effect is closely related in time to blood level is not usually effective; if the study design
uses such dosing, this should be explained, e.g., by pointing to pharmacodynamic
evidence that effect is prolonged compared to blood levels. The procedures used to seek
evidence of "escape" from drug effect at the end of the dose-interval, such as
measurements of effect just prior to dosing, should be described. Similarly, in a parallel
design dose-response study, the choice of doses should be explained.
9.3 Selection of Study Population
9.3.1 Inclusion criteria
The patient population and the selection criteria used to enter the patients into the study
should be described, and the suitability of the population for the purposes of the study
discussed. Specific diagnostic criteria used, as well as specific disease requirements
(e.g., disease of a particular severity or duration, results of a particular test or rating
scale(s) or physical examination, particular features of clinical history, such as failure or
success on prior therapy, or other potential prognostic factors and any age, sex or ethnic
factors) should be presented.
Screening criteria and any additional criteria for randomisation or entry into the test
drug/investigational product treatment part of the trial should be described. If there is
reason to believe that there were additional entry criteria, not defined in the protocol,
the implications of these should be discussed. For example, some investigators may
have excluded, or entered into other studies, patients who were particularly ill or who
had particular baseline characteristics.
9.3.2 Exclusion criteria
The criteria for exclusion at entry into the study should be specified and the rationale
(e.g., safety concerns, administrative reasons or lack of suitability for the trial) provided.
The impact of exclusions on the generalisability of the study should be discussed in
section 13 of the study report, or in an overview of safety and efficacy.
9.3.3 Removal of patients from therapy or assessment
The predetermined reasons for removing patients from therapy or assessment
observation, if any, should be described, as should the nature and duration of any
planned follow-up observations in those patients.
9.4 Treatments
9.4.1 Treatments administered
The precise treatments or diagnostic agents to be administered in each arm of the study,
and for each period of the study, should be described including route and mode of
administration, dose and dosage schedule.
9.4.2 Identity of investigational product(s)
In the text of the report, a brief description of the test drugs(s)/investigational product(s)
(formulation, strength, batch number(s)) should be given. If more than one batch of test
drug/investigational product was used, patients receiving each batch should be
identified in appendix 16.1.6.
© EMEA 2006 12
==================== Page 6 ====================
The source of placebos and active control/comparator product(s) should be provided.
Any modification of comparator product(s) from their usual commercial state should be
noted, and the steps taken to assure that their bioavailability was unaltered should be
described.
For long-duration trials of investigational products with limited shelf-lives or
incomplete stability data, the logistics of resupply of the materials should be described.
Any use of test materials past their expiry date should be noted, and patients receiving
them identified. If there were specific storage requirements, these should also be
described.
9.4.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
The specific methods used to assign patients to treatment groups, e.g., centralised
allocation, allocation within sites, adaptive allocation (that is, assignment on the basis of
earlier assignment or outcome) should be described in the text of the report, including
any stratification or blocking procedures. Any unusual features should be explained.
A detailed description of the randomisation method, including how it was executed,
should be given in appendix 16.1.7 with references cited if necessary. A table exhibiting
the randomisation codes, patient identifier, and treatment assigned should also be
presented in the appendix. For a multicentre study, the information should be given by
centre. The method of generating random numbers should be explained.
For a historically controlled trial, it is important to explain how the particular control
was selected and what other historical experiences were examined, if any, and how their
results compared to the control used.
9.4.4 Selection of doses in the study
The doses or dose ranges used in the study should be given for all treatments and the
basis for choosing them described (e.g., prior experience in humans, animal data).
9.4.5 Selection and timing of dose for each patient
Procedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/ investigational product and
active control/ comparator should be described. These procedures can vary from simple
random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to some specified titration
procedure, to more elaborate response-determined selection procedures, e.g. where dose
is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or some specified endpoint is achieved.
Procedures for back-titration, if any, should also be described.
The timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should
be described, and if it was not specified, this should be noted.
Any specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should be
described.
9.4.6 Blinding
A description of the specific procedures used to carry out blinding should be provided
(e.g., how bottles were labeled, labels that reveal blind-breakage, sealed code
list/envelopes, double dummy techniques),double dummy techniques), including the
circumstances in which the blind would be broken for an individual or for all patients,
e.g., for serious adverse events, the procedures used and who had access to patient
© EMEA 2006 13
==================== Page 7 ====================
codes. If the study allowed for some investigators to remain unblinded (e.g., to allow
them to adjust medication), the means of shielding other investigators should be
explained. Measures taken to ensure that test drug/investigational product and placebo
were indistinguishable and evidence that they were indistinguishable, should be
described, as should the appearance, shape, smell, and taste of the test material.
Measures to prevent unblinding by laboratory measurements, if used, should be
described. If there was a data monitoring committee with access to unblinded data,
procedures to ensure maintenance of overall study blinding should be described. The
procedure to maintain the blinding when interim analyses are performed should also be
explained.
If blinding was considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the
observations, this should be explained; e.g., use of a random-zero sphygmomanometer
eliminates possible observer bias in reading blood pressure and Holter tapes are often
read by automated systems that are presumably immune to observer bias. If blinding
was considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons and implications should be
discussed. Sometimes blinding is attempted but is known to be imperfect because of
obvious drug effects in at least some patients (dry mouth, bradycardia, fever, injection
site reactions, changes in laboratory data). Such problems or potential problems should
be identified and if there were any attempts to assess the magnitude of the problem or
manage it (e.g., by having some endpoint measurements carried out by people shielded
from information that might reveal treatment assignment), they should be described.
9.4.7 Prior and concomitant therapy
Which drugs or procedures were allowed before and during the study, whether and how
their use was recorded, and any other specific rules and procedures related to permitted
or forbidden concomitant therapy should be described. How allowed concomitant
therapy might affect the outcome due either to drug-drug interaction or to direct effects
on the study endpoints should be discussed, and how the independent effects of
concomitant and study therapies could be ascertained should be explained.
9.4.8 Treatment compliance
The measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance should be described,
e.g., drug accountability, diary cards, blood, urine or other body fluid drug level
measurements, or medication event monitoring.
9.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables
9.5.1 Efficacy and safety measurements assessed and flow chart
The specific efficacy and safety variables to be assessed and laboratory tests to be
conducted, their schedule (days of study, time of day, relation to meals, and the timing
of critical measures in relation to test drug administration, e.g., just prior to next dose,
two hours after dose), the methods for measuring them, and the persons responsible for
the measurements should be described. If there were changes in personnel carrying out
critical measurements, these should be reported.
It is usually helpful to display graphically in a flow chart (see Annex III of the
guideline) the frequency and timing of efficacy and safety measurements; visit numbers
and times should be shown, or, alternatively, times alone can be used (visit numbers
alone are more difficult to interpret). Any specific instructions (e.g., guidance or use of
a diary) to the patients should also be noted.
© EMEA 2006 14
==================== Page 8 ====================
Any definitions used to characterise outcome (e.g., criteria for determining occurrence
of acute myocardial infarction, designation of the location of the infarction,
characterisation of a stroke as thrombotic or hemorrhagic, distinction between TIA and
stroke, assignment of cause of death) should be explained in full. Any techniques used
to standardise or compare results of laboratory tests or other clinical measurements
(e.g., ECG, chest X-Ray) should also be described. This is particularly important in
multicentre studies.
If anyone other than the investigator was responsible for evaluation of clinical outcomes
(e.g., the sponsor or an external committee to review X-rays or ECGs or to determine
whether the patient had a stroke, acute infarction, or sudden death) the person or group
should be identified. The procedures, including means of maintaining blindness, and
centralising readings and measurements, should be described fully.
The means of obtaining adverse event data should be described (volunteered, checklist,
or, questioning), as should any specific rating scale(s) used and any specifically planned
follow-up procedures for adverse events or any planned rechallenge procedure.
Any rating of adverse events by the investigator, sponsor or external group, (e.g., rating
by severity, or, likelihood of drug causation) should be described. The criteria for such
ratings, if any, should be given and the parties responsible for the ratings should be
clearly identified. If efficacy or safety was to be assessed in terms of categorical ratings,
numerical scores, etc., the criteria used for point assignment (e.g., definitions of point
scores) should be provided. For multicentre studies, indicate how methods were
standardised.
9.5.2 Appropriateness of measurements
If any of the efficacy or safety assessments was not standard, i.e., widely used and
generally recognised as reliable, accurate, and relevant (able to discriminate between
effective and ineffective agents), its reliability, accuracy and relevance should be
documented. It may be helpful to describe alternatives considered but rejected.
If a surrogate end point (a laboratory measurement or physical measurement or sign that
is not a direct measure of clinical benefit) was used as a study end point, this should be
justified e.g., by reference to clinical data, publications, guidelines or previous actions
by regulatory authorities.
9.5.3 Primary efficacy variable(s)
The primary measurements and endpoints used to determine efficacy should be clearly
specified. Although the critical efficacy measurements may seem obvious, when there
are multiple variables, or when variables are measured repeatedly, the protocol should
identify the primary ones, with an explanation of why they were chosen, or designate
the pattern of significant findings or other method of combining information that would
be interpreted as supporting efficacy. If the protocol did not identify the primary
variables, the study report should explain how these critical variables were selected
(e.g., by reference to publications, guidelines or previous actions by regulatory
authorities) and when they were identified (i.e., before or after the study was completed
and unblinded). If an efficacy threshold was defined in the protocol, this should be
described.
© EMEA 2006 15
==================== Page 9 ====================
9.5.4 Drug concentration measurements
Any drug concentrations to be measured, and the sample collection times and periods in
relation to the timing of drug administration, should be described. Any relation of drug
administration and sampling to ingestion of food, posture and the possible effects of
concomitant medication/alcohol/caffeine/nicotine should also be addressed. The
biological sample measured, the handling of samples and the method of measurement
used should be described, referring to published and/or internal assay validation
documentation for methodological details. Where other factors are believed important in
assessing pharmacokinetics (e.g., soluble circulating receptors, renal or hepatic
function), the timing and plans to measure these factors should also be specified.
9.6 Data Quality Assurance
The quality assurance and quality control systems implemented to assure the quality of
the data should be described in brief. If none were used, this should be stated.
Documentation of inter-laboratory standardisation methods and quality assurance
procedures if used, should be provided under appendix 16.1.10.
Any steps taken at the investigation site or centrally to ensure the use of standard
terminology and the collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data, such
as training sessions, monitoring of investigators by sponsor personnel, instruction
manuals, data verification, cross-checking, use of a central laboratory for certain tests,
centralised ECG reading, or data audits, should be described. It should be noted whether
investigator meetings or other steps were taken to prepare investigators and standardise
performance.
If the sponsor used an independent internal or external auditing procedure, it should be
mentioned here and described in appendix 16.1.8; and audit certificates, if available,
should be provided in the same appendix.
9.7 Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample Size
9.7.1 Statistical and analytical plans
The statistical analyses planned in the protocol and any changes made before outcome
results were available should be described. In this section emphasis should be on which
analyses, comparisons and statistical tests were planned, not on which ones were
actually used. If critical measurements were made more than once, the particular
measurements (e.g., average of several measurements over the entire study, values at
particular times, values only from study completers, or last on-therapy value) planned as
the basis for comparison of test drug/investigational product and control should be
specified. Similarly, if more than one analytical approach is plausible, e.g., changes
from baseline response, slope analysis, life table analysis, the planned approach should
be identified. Also, whether the primary analysis is to include adjustment for covariates
should be specified.
If there were any planned reasons for excluding from analysis patients for whom data
are available, these should be described. If there were any subgroups whose results were
to be examined separately, these should be identified. If categorical responses (global
scales, severity scores, responses of a certain size) were to be used in analysing
responses, they should be clearly defined.
Planned monitoring of the results of the study should be described. If there was a data
monitoring committee, either within or outside the sponsor's control, its composition
© EMEA 2006 16
==================== Page 10 ====================
and operating procedures should be described and procedures to maintain study blinding
should be given. The frequency and nature of any planned interim analysis, any
specified circumstances in which the study would be terminated, and any statistical
adjustments to be employed because of interim analyses should be described.
9.7.2 Determination of sample size
The planned sample size and the basis for it, such as statistical considerations or
practical limitations, should be provided. Methods for sample size calculation should
be given together with their derivations or source of reference. Estimates used in the
calculations should be given and explanations provided as to how they were obtained.
For a study intended to show a difference between treatments, the difference the study is
designed to detect should be specified. For a positive control study intended to show
that a new therapy is at least as effective as the standard therapy, the sample size
determination should specifiy the difference between treatments that would be
considered unacceptably large and therefore the difference the study is designed to be
able to exclude.
9.8 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses
Any change in the conduct of the study or planned analyses (e.g., dropping a treatment
group, changing the entry criteria or drug dosages, adjusting the sample size, etc.)
instituted after the start of the study should be described. The time(s) and reason(s) for
the change(s), the procedure used to decide on the change(s), the person(s) or group(s)
responsible for the change(s) and the nature and content of the data available (and to
whom they were available) when the change was made should also be described,
whether the change was documented as a formal protocol amendment or not (personnel
changes need not be included.) Any possible implications of the change(s) for the
interpretation of the study should be discussed briefly in this section and more fully in
other appropriate sections of the report. In every section of the report, a clear distinction
between conditions (procedures) planned in the protocol and amendments or additions
should be made. In general, changes made prior to breaking the blind have limited
implications for study interpretation. It is therefore particularly critical that the timing of
changes relative to blind breaking and availability of outcome results be well
characterised.
10. STUDY PATIENTS
10.1 Disposition of Patients
There should be a clear accounting of all patients who entered the study, using figures
or tables in the text of the report. The numbers of patients who were randomised, and
who entered and completed each phase of the study, (or each week/month of the study)
should be provided, as well as the reasons for all post-randomisation discontinuations,
grouped by treatment and by major reason (lost to follow-up, adverse event, poor
compliance etc.). It may also be relevant to provide the number of patients screened for
inclusion and a breakdown of the reasons for excluding patients during screening, if this
could help clarify the appropriate patient population for eventual drug use. A flow chart
is often helpful (see Annexes IVa and IVb of the guideline for example). Whether
patients are followed for the duration of the study, even if drug is discontinued, should
be made clear.
In appendix 16.2.1, there should also be a listing of all patients discontinued from the
study after enrollment, broken down by centre and treatment group, giving a patient
© EMEA 2006 17
==================== Page 11 ====================
identifier, the specific reason for discontinuation, the treatment (drug and dose),
cumulative dose, (where appropriate), and the duration of treatment before
discontinuation. Whether or not the blind for the patient was broken at the time of
discontinuation should be noted. It may also be useful to include other information,
such as critical demographic data (e.g. age, sex, race), concomitant medication, and the
major response variable(s) at termination. See Annex V for an example of such a listing.
10.2 Protocol Deviations
All important deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the
trial, patient management or patient assessment should be described.
In the body of the text, protocol deviations should be appropriately summarised by
centre and grouped into different categories, such as:
• those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria
• those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn
© EMEA 2006 18
==================== Page 12 ====================
• those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose
• those who received an excluded concomitant treatment
In appendix 16.2.2, individual patients with these protocol deviations should be listed,
broken down by centre for multicentre studies.
11. EFFICACY EVALUATION
11.1 Data Sets Analysed
Exactly which patients were included in each efficacy analysis should be precisely
defined, e.g., all patients receiving any investigational products, all patients with any
efficacy observation or with a certain minimum number of observations, only patients
completing the trial, all patients with an observation during a particular time window,
only patients with a specified degree of compliance, etc. It should be clear, if not
defined in the study protocol, when, (relative to study unblinding), and how
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the data sets analysed were developed. Generally, even if
the applicant's proposed primary analysis is based on a reduced subset of the patients
with data, there should also be for any trial intended to establish efficacy an additional
analysis using all randomised (or otherwise entered) patients with any on-treatment
data.
There should be a tabular listing of all patients, visits and observations excluded from
the efficacy analysis provided in appendix 16.2.3 (see Annex VI of the guideline for an
example). The reasons for exclusions should also be analysed for the whole treatment
group over time (see Annex VII of the guideline for an example).
11.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Group data for the critical demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients, as
well as other factors arising during the study that could affect response, should be
presented in this section and comparability of the treatment groups for all relevant
characteristics should be displayed by use of tables or graphs in section 14.1. The data
for the patient sample included in the "all patients with data" analysis should be given
first. This can then be followed by data on other groups used in principal analyses, such
as the "per-protocol" analysis or other analyses, e.g., groups defined by compliance,
concomitant disease/ therapy, or demographic/ baseline characteristics. When such
groups are used, data for the complementary excluded group should also be shown. In a
multicentre study, where appropriate, comparability should be assessed by centre, and
centres should be compared.
A diagram showing the relationship between the entire sample and any other analysis
groups should be provided.
The critical variables will depend on the specific nature of the disease and on the
protocol but will usually include:
© EMEA 2006 19
==================== Page 13 ====================
• demographic variables
- age
- sex
- race
• disease factors
- specific entry criteria (if not uniform), duration, stage and severity of disease and
other clinical classifications and sub-groupings in common usage or of known
prognostic significance.
- baseline values for critical clinical measurements carried out during the study or
identified as important indicators of prognosis or response to therapy.
- concomitant illness at trial initiation, such as renal disease, diabetes, heart failure
- relevant previous illness
- relevant previous treatment for illness treated in the study
- concomitant treatment maintained, even if the dose was changed during the study,
including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy; treatments
stopped at entry into the study period (or changed at study initiation)
• other factors that might affect response to therapy (e.g., weight, renin status,
antibody levels, metabolic status)
• other possibly relevant variables (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake, special diets) and, for
women, menstrual status and date of last menstrual period, if pertinent for the study.
In addition to tables and graphs giving group data for these baseline variables, relevant
individual patient demographic and baseline data, including laboratory values, and all
concomitant medication for all individual patients randomised (broken down by
treatment and by centre for multicentre studies) should be presented in by-patient
tabular listings in appendix 16.2.4. Although some regulatory authorities will require all
baseline data to be presented elsewhere in tabular listings, the appendix to the study
report should be limited to only the most relevant data, generally the variables listed
above.
11.3 Measurements of Treatment Compliance
Any measurements of compliance of individual patients with the treatment regimen
under study and drug concentrations in body fluids should be summarised, analysed by
treatment group and time interval, and tabulated in Appendix 16.2.5.
11.4 Efficacy Results and Tabulations of Individual Patient Data
11.4.1 Analysis of efficacy
Treatment groups should be compared for all critical measures of efficacy (primary
and secondary end-points; pharmacodynamic endpoints studied), as well as benefit/
risk assessment(s) in each patient where these are utilised. In general, the results of
all analyses contemplated in the protocol and an analysis including all patients with
on-study data should be performed in studies intended to establish efficacy. The
analysis should show the size (point estimate) of the difference between the
treatments, the associated confidence interval and, where utilised, the results of
hypothesis testing.
Analyses based on continuous variables (e.g., mean blood pressure or depression
scale score) and categorical responses (e.g., cure of an infection) can be equally
valid; ordinarily both should be presented if both were planned and are available. If
© EMEA 2006 20
==================== Page 14 ====================
categories are newly created, (i.e., not in the statistical plan) the basis for them
should be explained. Even if one variable receives primary attention (e.g., in a blood
pressure study, supine blood pressure at week x), other reasonable measures (e.g.
standing blood pressure and blood pressures at other particular times) should be
assessed, at least briefly. In addition, the time course of response should be
described, if possible. For a multicentre study, where appropriate, data display and
analysis of individual centres should be included for critical variables to give a clear
picture of the results at each site, especially the larger sites.
If any critical measurements or assessments of efficacy or safety outcomes were
made by more than one party (e.g., both the investigator and an expert committee
may offer an opinion on whether a patient had an acute infarction), overall
differences between the ratings should be shown, and each patient having disparate
assessments should be identified. The assessments used should be clear in all
analyses.
In many cases, efficacy and safety endpoints are difficult to distinguish, (e.g., deaths
in a fatal disease study). Many of the principles addressed below should be adopted
for critical safety measures as well.
11.4.2 Statistical/analytical issues
The statistical analysis used should be described for clinical and statistical reviewers
in the text of the report, with detailed documentation of statistical methods (see
section Annex IX) presented in appendix 16.1.9. Important features of the analysis
including the particular methods used, adjustments made for demographic or
baseline measurements or concomitant therapy, handling of drop-outs and missing
data, adjustments for multiple comparisons, special analyses of multicentre studies,
and adjustments for interim analyses, should be discussed. Any changes in the
analysis made after blind-breaking should be identified.
In addition to the general discussion the following specific issues should be
addressed (unless not applicable) :
11.4.2.1 Adjustments for Covariates
Selection of, and adjustments for, demographic or baseline measurements,
concomitant therapy, or any other covariate or prognostic factor should be explained
in the report, and methods of adjustment, results of analyses, and supportive
information (e.g., ANCOVA or Cox regression output) should be included in the
detailed documentation of statistical methods. If the covariates or methods used in
these analyses differed from those planned in the protocol, the differences should be
explained and where possible and relevant, the results of planned analyses should
also be presented. Although not part of the individual study report, comparisons of
covariate adjustments and prognostic factors across individual studies may be an
informative analysis in a summary of clinical efficacy data.
© EMEA 2006 21
==================== Page 15 ====================
11.4.2.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data
There are several factors that may affect dropout rates. These include the duration of
the study, the nature of the disease, the efficacy and toxicity of the drug under study,
and other factors that are not therapy related. Ignoring the patients who dropped out
of the study and drawing conclusions based only on patients who completed the
study can be misleading. A large number of dropouts, however, even if included in
an analysis, may introduce bias, particularly if there are more early dropouts in one
treatment group or the reasons for dropping out are treatment or outcome related.
Although the effects of early dropouts, and sometimes even the direction of bias, can
be difficult to determine, possible effects should be explored as fully as possible. It
may be helpful to examine the observed cases at various time points or, if dropouts
were very frequent, to concentrate on analyses at time points when most of the
patients were still under observation and when the full effect of the drug was
realised. It may also be helpful to examine modelling approaches to the evaluation of
such incomplete data sets.
The results of a clinical trial should be assessed not only for the subset of patients
who completed the study, but also for the entire patient population as randomised or
at least for all those with any on-study measurements. Several factors need to be
considered and compared for the treatment groups in analysing the effects of
dropouts: the reasons for the dropouts, the time to dropout, and the proportion of
dropouts among treatment groups at various time points.
Procedures for dealing with missing data, e.g., use of estimated or derived data,
should be described. Detailed explanation should be provided as to how such
estimations or derivations were done and what underlying assumptions were made.
11.4.2.3 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
The process of examining and analysing data accumulating in a clinical trial, either
formally or informally, can introduce bias and/or increase type I error. Therefore, all
interim analyses, formal or informal, pre-planned or ad hoc, by any study participant,
sponsor staff member, or data monitoring group should be described in full, even if
the treatment groups were not identified. The need for statistical adjustment because
of such analyses should be addressed. Any operating instructions or procedures used
for such analyses should be described. The minutes of meetings of any data
monitoring group and any data reports reviewed at those meetings, particularly a
meeting that led to a change in the protocol or early termination of the study, may be
helpful and should be provided in appendix 16.1.9. Data monitoring without code-
breaking should also be described, even if this kind of monitoring is considered to
cause no increase in type I error.
11.4.2.4 Multicentre Studies
A multicentre study is a single study under a common protocol, involving several
centres (e.g. clinics, practices, hospitals) where the data collected are intended to be
analysed as a whole (as opposed to a post-hoc decision to combine data or results
from separate studies). Individual centre results should be presented, however, where
appropriate, e.g., when the centres have sufficient numbers of patients to make such
analysis potentially valuable, the possibility of qualitative or quantitative treatment-
by-centre interaction should be explored. Any extreme or opposite results among
centres should be noted and discussed, considering such possibilities as differences
in study conduct, patient characteristics, or clinical settings. Treatment comparison
© EMEA 2006 22
==================== Page 16 ====================
should include analyses that allow for centre differences with respect to response. If
appropriate, demographic, baseline, and post-baseline data, as well as efficacy data,
should be presented by centre, even though the combined analysis is the primary one.
11.4.2.5 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
False positive findings increase in number as the number of significance tests
(number of comparisons) performed increases. If there was more than one primary
endpoint (outcome variable), more than one analysis of particular endpoint, or if
there were multiple treatment groups, or subsets of the patient population being
examined, the statistical analysis should reflect awareness of this and either explain
the statistical adjustment used for type I error criteria or give reasons why it was
considered unnecessary.
11.4.2.6 Use of an "Efficacy Subset" of Patients
Particular attention should be devoted to the effects of dropping patients with
available data from analyses because of poor compliance, missed visits, ineligibility,
or any other reason. As noted above, an analysis using all available data should be
carried out for all studies intended to establish efficacy, even if it is not the analysis
proposed as the primary analysis by the applicant. In general, it is advantageous to
demonstrate robustness of the principal trial conclusions with respect to alternative
choices of patient populations for analysis. Any substantial differences resulting
from the choice of patient population for analysis should be the subject of explicit
discussion.
11.4.2.7 Active-Control Studies Intended to Show Equivalence
If an active control study is intended to show equivalence (i.e. lack of a difference
greater than a specified size) between the test drug/investigational product and the
active control/comparator, the analysis should show the confidence interval for the
comparison between the two agents for critical end points and the relation of that
interval to the prespecified degree of inferiority that would be considered
unacceptable. (See 9.2 for important considerations when using the active control
equivalence design.)
11.4.2.8 Examination of Subgroups
If the size of the study permits, important demographic or baseline value-defined
subgroups should be examined for unusually large or small responses and the results
presented, e.g., comparison of effects by age, sex, or race, by severity or prognostic
groups, by history of prior treatment with a drug of the same class, etc. If these
analyses were not carried out because the study was too small it should be noted.
These analyses are not intended to "salvage" an otherwise non-supportive study but
may suggest hypotheses worth examining in other studies or be helpful in refining
labeling information, patient selection, dose selection, etc. Where there is a prior
hypothesis of a differential effect in a particular subgroup, this hypothesis and its
assessment should be part of the planned statistical analysis.
11.4.3 Tabulation of individual response data
In addition to tables and graphs representing group data, individual response data and
other relevant study information should be presented in tables. Some regulatory
authorities may require all individual data in archival case report tabulations. What
© EMEA 2006 23
==================== Page 17 ====================
needs to be included in the report will vary from study to study and from one drug
class to another and the applicant must decide, if possible after consultation with the
regulatory authority, what to include in appendix to the study report. The study
report should indicate what material is included as an appendix, what is in the more
extensive archival case report tabulations, if required by the regulatory authority, and
what is available on request.
For a controlled study in which critical efficacy measurements or assessments (e.g.,
blood or urine cultures, pulmonary function tests, angina frequency, or global
evaluations) are repeated at intervals, the data listings accompanying the report
should include, for each patient, a patient identifier, all measured or observed values
of critical measurements, including baseline measurements, with notation of the time
during the study (e.g., days on therapy and time of day, if relevant) when the
measurements were made, the drug/dose at the time (if useful, given as mg/kg), any
measurements of compliance, and any concomitant medications at the time of, or
close to the time of, measurement or assessment. If, aside from repeated assessments,
the study included some overall responder vs non-responder evaluation(s),
(bacteriologic cure or failure), it should also be included. In addition to critical
measurements, the tabulation should note whether the patient was included in the
efficacy evaluation (and which evaluation, if more than one), provide patient
compliance information, if collected, and a reference to the location of the case
report form, if included. Critical baseline information such as age, sex, weight,
disease being treated (if more than one in study), and disease stage or severity, is also
helpful. The baseline values for critical measurements would ordinarily be included
as zero time values for each efficacy measurement.
The tabulation described should usually be included in appendix 16.2.6 of the study
report, rather than in the more extensive case report tabulations required by some
regulatory authorities, because it represents the basic efficacy data supporting
summary tables. Such a thorough tabulation can be unwieldy for review purposes,
however, and it is expected that more targeted displays will be developed as well.
For example, if there are many measurements reported, tabulations of the most
critical measurements for each patient (e.g., the blood pressure value at certain visits
might be more important than others) will be useful in providing an overview of each
individual's results in a study, with each patient's response summarised on a single
line or small number of lines.
11.4.4 Drug dose, drug concentration, and relationships to response
When the dose in each patient can vary, the actual doses received by patients should
be shown and individual patient's doses should be tabulated. Although studies not
designed as dose-response studies may have limited ability to contribute dose-
response information, the available data should be examined for whatever
information they can yield. In examining the dose response, it may be helpful to
calculate dose as mg/kg body weight or mg/m² body surface.
Drug concentration information, if available, should also be tabulated (Appendix
16.2.5), analysed in pharmacokinetic terms and, if possible, related to response.
Further guidance on the design and analysis of studies exploring dose-response or
concentration response can be found in the ICH Guideline "Dose-Response
Information to Support Drug Registration".
© EMEA 2006 24
==================== Page 18 ====================
11.4.5 Drug-drug and drug-disease interactions
Any apparent relationship between response and concomitant therapy and between
response and past and/or concurrent illness should be described.
11.4.6 By-patient displays
While individual patient data ordinarily can be displayed in tabular listings, it has on
occasion been helpful to construct individual patient profiles in other formats, such
as graphic displays. These might, for example, show the value of (a) particular
parameter(s) over time, the drug dose over the same period, and the times of
particular events (e.g., an adverse event or change in concomitant therapy). Where
group mean data represent the principal analyses, this kind of "case report extract"
may offer little advantage; it may be helpful, however, if overall evaluation of
individual responses is a critical part of the analysis.
11.4.7 Efficacy conclusions
The important conclusions concerning efficacy should be concisely described,
considering primary and secondary end points, pre-specified and alternative
statistical approaches and results of exploratory analyses.
12. SAFETY EVALUATION
Analysis of safety-related data can be considered at three levels. First, the extent of
exposure (dose, duration, number of patients) should be examined to determine the
degree to which safety can be assessed from the study. Second, the more common
adverse events, laboratory test changes, etc. should be identified, classified in some
reasonable way, compared for treatment groups, and analysed, as appropriate, for
factors that may affect the frequency of adverse reactions/events, such as time
dependence, relation to demographic characteristics, relation to dose or drug
concentration, etc. Finally, serious adverse events and other significant adverse events
should be identified, usually by close examination of patients who left the study
prematurely because of an adverse event, whether or not identified as drug related, or
who died.
The ICH Guideline on Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for
Expedited Reporting defines serious adverse events as follows: A "serious adverse
event" (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of
existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a
congenital anomaly/birth defect.
For the purpose of this guideline, "other significant adverse events" are marked
haematological and other laboratory abnormalities and any adverse events that led to an
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant
additional concomitant therapy.
In the following sections, three kinds of analysis and display are called for:
1) summarised data, often using tables and graphical presentations presented in the
main body of the report;
2) listings of individual patient data, and
© EMEA 2006 25
==================== Page 19 ====================
3) narrative statements of events of particular interest.
In all tabulations and analyses, events associated with both test drug and control
treatment should be displayed.
12.1 Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure to test drugs/investigational products (and to active control and
placebo) should be characterised according to the number of patients exposed, the
duration of exposure, and the dose to which they were exposed.
• Duration: Duration of exposure to any dose can be expressed as a median or mean,
but it is also helpful to describe the number of patients exposed for specified periods
of time, such as for one day or less, 2 days to one week, more than one week to one
month, more than one month to 6 months, etc. The numbers exposed to test
drug(s)/investigational product(s) for the various durations should also be broken
down into age, sex, and racial subgroups, and any other pertinent subgroups, such as
disease (if more than one is represented), disease severity, concurrent illness.
• Dose: The mean or median dose used and the number of patients exposed to
specified daily dose levels should be given; the daily dose levels used could be the
maximum dose for each patient, the dose with longest exposure for each patient, or
the mean daily dose. It is often useful to provide combined dose-duration
information, such as the numbers exposed for a given duration (e.g., at least one
month) to the most common dose, the highest dose, the maximum recommended
dose, etc. In some cases, cumulative dose might be pertinent. Dosage may be given
as the actual daily dose or on a mg/kg or mg/m² basis as appropriate. The numbers of
patients exposed to various doses should be broken down into age, sex, and racial
subgroups, and any other pertinent subgroups.
• Drug concentration: If available, drug concentration data (e.g., concentration at the
time of an event, maximum plasma concentration, area under curve) may be helpful
in individual patients for correlation with adverse events or changes in laboratory
variables. (Appendix 16.2.5.)
It is assumed that all patients entered into treatment who received at least one dose of
the treatment are included in the safety analysis; if that is not so, an explanation
should be provided.
12.2 Adverse Events (AEs)
12.2.1 Brief summary of adverse events
The overall adverse event experience in the study should be described in a brief
narrative, supported by the following more detailed tabulations and analyses. In these
tabulations and analyses, events associated with both the test drug and control
treatment should be displayed.
12.2.2 Display of adverse events
All adverse events occurring after initiation of study treatments (including events
likely to be related to the underlying disease or likely to represent concomitant
illness, unless there is a prior agreement with the regulatory authority to consider
specified events as disease related) should be displayed in summary tables (section
© EMEA 2006 26
==================== Page 20 ====================
14.3.1). The tables should include changes in vital signs and any laboratory changes
that were considered serious adverse events or other significant adverse events.
In most cases, it will also be useful to describe in such tables, "treatment emergent
signs and symptoms" (TESS; those not seen at baseline, and those that worsened
even if present at baseline).
The tables should list each adverse event, the number of patients in each treatment
group in whom the event occurred, and the rate of occurrence. When treatments are
cyclical, e.g. cancer chemotherapy, it may also be helpful to list results separately for
each cycle. Adverse events should be grouped by body system. Each event may
then be divided into defined severity categories (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) if these
were used. The tables may also divide the adverse events into those considered at
least possibly related to drug use and those considered not related, or use some other
causality scheme (e.g., unrelated or possibly, probably, or definitely related). Even
when such a causality assessment is used, the tables should include all adverse
events, whether or not considered drug related, including events thought to represent
intercurrent illnesses. Subsequent analyses of the study or of the overall safety data
base may help to distinguish between adverse events that are, or are not, considered
drug related. So that it is possible to analyse and evaluate the data in these tables, it
is important to identify each patient having each adverse event. An example of such
a tabular presentation is shown below.

** Patient identification number
In addition to these complete tables provided in 14.3.1, an additional summary table
comparing treatment and control groups, without the patient identifying numbers
limited to relatively common adverse events (e.g., those in at least 1% of the treated
group), should be provided in the body of the report.
In presenting adverse events, it is important both to display the original terms used
by the investigator and to attempt to group related events (i.e., events that probably
represent the same phenomena) so that the true occurrence rate is not obscured. One
way to do this is with a standard adverse reaction/events dictionary.
12.2.3 Analysis of adverse events
The basic display of adverse event rates described in section 12.2.2 (and located in
section 14.3.1) of the report, should be used to compare rates in treatment and
control groups. For this analysis it may be helpful to combine the event severity
categories and the causality categories, leading to a simpler side-by-side comparison
of treatment groups. In addition, although this is usually best done in an integrated
analysis of safety, if study size and design permit, it may be useful to examine the
more common adverse events that seem to be drug related for relationship to dosage
and to mg/kg or mg/m² dose, to dose regimen, to duration of treatment, to total dose,
to demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, race, to other baseline features, such
as renal status to efficacy outcomes, and to drug concentration. It may also be useful
to examine time of onset and duration of adverse events. A variety of additional
© EMEA 2006 28
==================== Page 22 ====================
analyses may be suggested by the study results or by the pharmacology of the test
drug/investigational product.
It is not intended that every adverse event be subjected to rigorous statistical
evaluation. It may be apparent from initial display and inspection of the data that a
significant relation to demographic or other baseline features is not present. If the
studies are small and if the number of events is relatively small, it may be sufficient
to limit analyses to a comparison of treatment and control.
Under certain circumstances, life table or similar analyses may be more informative
than reporting of crude adverse event rates. When treatments are cyclical, e.g. cancer
chemotherapy, it may also be helpful to analyse results separately for each cycle.
12.2.4 Listing of adverse events by patient
All adverse events for each patient, including the same event on several occasions
should be listed in appendix 16.2.7, giving both preferred term and the original term
used by the investigator. The listing should be by investigator and by treatment group
and should include:
• Patient identifier
• Age, race, sex, weight (height, if relevant)
• Location of CRFs, if provided.
• The adverse event (preferred term, reported term)
• Duration of the adverse event
• Severity (e.g. mild, moderate, severe)
• Seriousness (serious/non-serious)
• Action taken (none, dose reduced, treatment stopped, specific treatment instituted,
etc.)
• Outcome (e.g., CIOMS format)
• Causality assessment, (e.g., related/not related). How this was determined should
be described in the table or elsewhere.
• Date of onset or date of clinic visit at which the event was discovered
• Timing of onset of the adverse event in relation to last dose of test
drug/investigational product (when applicable)
• Study treatment at time of event or most recent study treatment taken
• Test drug/investigational product dose in absolute amount, mg/kg or mg/m² at
time of event
• Drug concentration (if known)
• Duration of test drug/investigational product treatment
• Concomitant treatment during study
© EMEA 2006 29
==================== Page 23 ====================
Any abbreviations and codes should be clearly explained at the beginning of the
listing or, preferably, on each page.
12.3 Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events
Deaths, other serious adverse events, and other significant adverse deserve special
attention.
12.3.1 Listing of deaths, other serious adverse events, and other significant adverse
events
Listings, containing the same information as called for in section 12.2.4 above,
should be provided for the following events.
12.3.1.1 Deaths
All deaths during the study, including the post treatment follow-up period, and
deaths that resulted from a process that began during the study, should be listed by
patient in section 14.3.2.
12.3.1.2 Other Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events (other than death but including the serious adverse events
temporally associated with or preceding the deaths) should be listed in section 14.3.2
The listing should include laboratory abnormalities, abnormal vital signs and
abnormal physical observations that were considered serious adverse events.
12.3.1.3 Other Significant Adverse Events
Marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other than those meeting
the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, including
withdrawal of test drug/investigational product treatment, dose reduction, or
significant additional concomitant therapy, other than those reported as serious
adverse events, should be listed in section 14.3.2.
12.3.2 Narratives of deaths, other serious adverse events, and certain other significant
adverse events
There should be brief narratives describing each death, each other serious adverse
event, and those of the other significant adverse events that are judged to be of
special interest because of clinical importance. These narratives can be placed either
in the text of the report or in section 14.3.3, depending on their number. Events that
were clearly unrelated to the test drug/investigational product may be omitted or
described very briefly. In general, the narrative should describe the following:
the nature and intensity of event, the clinical course leading up to event, with an
indication of timing relevant to test drug/investigational product administration
relevant laboratory measurements, whether the drug was stopped, and when;
countermeasures; post mortem findings; investigator's opinion on causality, and
sponsor's opinion on causality, if appropriate.
In addition, the following information should be included:
• Patient identifier
• Age and sex of patient; general clinical condition of patient, if appropriate
© EMEA 2006 30
==================== Page 24 ====================
• Disease being treated (if the same for all patients this is not required) with
duration (of current episode) of illness
• Relevant concomitant/previous illnesses with details of occurrence/ duration
• Relevant concomitant/previous medication with details of dosage
• Test drug/investigational product administered, drug dose, if this varied among
patients, and length of time administered
12.3.3 Analysis and discussion of deaths, other serious adverse events, and other
significant adverse events
The significance of the deaths, other serious adverse events and other significant
adverse events leading to withdrawal, dose reduction or institution of concomitant
therapy should be assessed with respect to the safety of the test drug/investigational
product. Particular attention should be paid to whether any of these events may
represent a previously unsuspected important adverse effect of the test
drug/investigational product. For serious adverse events that appear of particular
importance, it maybe useful to use life table or similar analyses to show their relation
to time on test drug/investigational product and to assess their risk over time.
12.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
12.4.1 Listing of individual laboratory measurements by patient (16.2.8) and each
abnormal laboratory value (14.3.4)
When required by regulatory authorities, the results of all safety-related laboratory
tests should be available in tabular listings, using a display similar to the following,
where each row represents a patient visit at which a laboratory study was done, with
patients grouped by investigator (if more than one) and treatment group, and
columns include critical demographic data, drug dose data, and the results of the
laboratory tests. As not all tests can be displayed in a single table, they should be
grouped logically (haematological tests, liver chemistries, electrolytes, urinalysis,
etc.). Abnormal values should be identified, e.g. by underlining, bracketing etc.
These listings should be submitted as part of the registration/ marketing application,
when this is required, or may be available on request.

T21 V14 V17 V20
T32 V15 V18 V21
* Vn = value of a particular test
For all regulatory authorities, there should be a by-patient listing of all abnormal
laboratory values in section 14.3.4, using the format described above. For laboratory
abnormalities of special interest (abnormal laboratory values of potential clinical
importance), it may also be useful to provide additional data, such as normal values
before and after the abnormal value, and values of related laboratory tests. In some
cases, it may be desirable to exclude certain abnormal values from further analysis.
For example, single, non-replicated, small abnormalities of some tests (e.g., uric acid
or electrolytes) or occasional low values of some tests (e.g., transaminase, alkaline
phosphatase, BUN, etc.) can probably be defined as clinically insignificant and
excluded. Any such decisions should be clearly explained, however, and the
complete list of values provided (or available to authorities on request) should
identify every abnormal value.
12.4.2 Evaluation of each laboratory parameter
The necessary evaluation of laboratory values must in part be determined by the
results seen, but, in general, the following analyses should be provided. For each
analysis, comparison of the treatment and control groups should be carried out, as
appropriate, and as compatible with study size. In addition, normal laboratory ranges
should be given for each analysis.
12.4.2.1 Laboratory Values Over Time
For each parameter at each time over the course of the study (e.g., at each visit) the
following should be described : the group mean or median values, the range of
values, and the number of patients with abnormal values, or with abnormal values
that are of a certain size (e.g., twice the upper limit of normal, 5 times the upper
limit; choices should be explained). Graphs may be used.
© EMEA 2006 32
==================== Page 26 ====================
12.4.2.2 Individual Patient Changes
An analysis of individual patient changes by treatment group should be given. A
variety of approaches may be used, including:
1. "Shift tables" - These tables show the number of patients who are low, normal, or
high at baseline and then at selected time intervals.
2. Tables showing the number or fraction of patients who had a change in parameter
of a predetermined size at selected time intervals. For example, for BUN, it might
be decided that a change of more than 10 mg/dL BUN should be noted. For this
parameter, the number of patients having a change less than this or greater than
this would be shown for one or more visits, usually grouping patients separately
depending on baseline BUN (normal or elevated). The possible advantage of this
display, compared to the usual shift table, is that changes of a certain size are
noted, even if the final value is not abnormal.
3. A graph comparing the initial value and the on-treatment values of a laboratory
measurement for each patient by locating the point defined by the initial value on
the abscissa and a subsequent value on the ordinate. If no changes occur, the point
representing each patient will be located on the 45˚ line. A general shift to higher
values will show a clustering of points above the 45˚ line. As this display usually
shows only a single time point for a single treatment, interpretation requires a
time series of these plots for treatment and control groups. Alternatively the
display could show baseline and most extreme on-treatment value. These displays
identify outliers readily (it is useful to include patient identifiers for the outliers).
12.4.2.3 Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities
Clinically significant changes (defined by the applicant) should be discussed. A
narrative of each patient whose laboratory abnormality was considered a serious
adverse event and, in certain cases, considered an other significant adverse event,
should be provided under sections 12.3.2 or 14.3.3. When toxicity grading scales are
used (e.g., WHO, NCI), changes graded as severe should be discussed regardless of
seriousness. An analysis of the clinically significant changes, together with a
recapitulation of discontinuations due to laboratory measurements, should be
provided for each parameter. The significance of the changes and likely relation to
the treatment should be assessed, e.g., by analysis of such features as relationship to
dose, relationship to drug concentration, disappearance on continued therapy,
positive dechallenge, positive rechallenge, and the nature of concomitant therapy.
12.5 Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety
Vital signs, other physical findings, and other observations related to safety should be
analysed and presented in a way similar to laboratory variables. If there is evidence of a
drug effect, any dose-response or drug concentration-response relationship or
relationship to patient variables (e.g., disease, demographics, concomitant therapy)
should be identified and the clinical relevance of the observation described. Particular
attention should be given to changes not evaluated as efficacy variables and to those
considered to be adverse events.

12.6 Safety Conclusions
The overall safety evaluation of the test drug(s)/investigational product(s) should be
reviewed, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for
concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and
deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk should be identified and
particular attention paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small
numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked
abnormalities of drug metabolism or excretion etc. The implication of the safety
evaluation for the possible uses of the drug should be described.
13. DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
The efficacy and safety results of the study and the relationship of risks and benefit
should be briefly summarised and discussed, referring to the tables, figures, and sections
above as needed. The presentation should not simply repeat the description of results
nor introduce new results.
The discussion and conclusions should clearly identify any new or unexpected findings,
comment on their significance and discuss any potential problems such as
inconsistencies between related measures. The clinical relevance and importance of the
results should also be discussed in the light of other existing data. Any specific benefits
or special precautions required for individual subjects or at-risk groups and any
implications for the conduct of future studies should be identified. Alternatively, such
discussions may be reserved for summaries of safety and efficacy referring to the entire
dossier (integrated summaries).
14. TABLES, FIGURES AND GRAPHS REFERRED TO BUT NOT INCLUDED IN
THE TEXT
Figures should be used to visually summarise the important results, or to clarify results
that are not easily understood from tables.
Important demographic, efficacy and safety data should be presented in summary
figures or tables in the text of the report. However, if these become obtrusive because of
size or number they should be presented here, cross-referenced to the text, along with
supportive, or additional, figures, tables or listings.
The following information may be presented in this section of the core clinical study
report:
14.1 Demographic Data
Summary figures and tables
14.2 Efficacy Data

15. REFERENCE LIST
A list of articles from the literature pertinent to the evaluation of the study should be
provided. Copies of important publications should be attached in an appendix (16.1.11
and 16.1.12). References should be given in accordance with the internationally
accepted standards of the 1979 Vancouver Declaration on "Uniform Requirements for
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals" or the system used in "Chemical
Abstracts".
16. APPENDICES
This section should be prefaced by a full list of all appendices available for the study
report. Where permitted by the regulatory authority, some of the following appendices
need not be submitted with the report but need to be provided only on request.
The applicant should therefore clearly indicate those appendices that are submitted with
the report.
N.B. In order to have appendices available on request, they should be finalised by the
time of filing of the submission.
